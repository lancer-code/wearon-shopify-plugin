## Project Overview
`wearon-shopify` is the Shopify storefront extension layer for WearOn. It delivers a mobile-first, in-theme shopper experience for fit/size confidence with accessibility and billing-mode-aware behavior, without camera or extension-level age gating in the target architecture.

## Quick Reference

- **Stack:** Shopify theme app extension + Liquid + vanilla JS (ESM) + Vitest
- **Entry Point:** `extensions/wearon-tryon/blocks/tryon-block.liquid`

## Existing Documentation
Source planning/implementation docs were intentionally excluded from this index listing per workflow guidance for this run.

## Getting Started
1. Read [Project Overview](./project-overview.md).
2. Review [Architecture](./architecture.md) and [API Contracts](./api-contracts.md).
3. For UI/runtime changes, use [Component Inventory](./component-inventory.md) and [Development Guide](./development-guide.md).
4. Run tests with `npm test` before and after changes.

## For AI-Assisted Development
- For storefront behavior changes: reference `architecture.md`, `component-inventory.md`, and `api-contracts.md` together.
- For billing/resell changes: verify mode logic and API contracts alignment.
- For accessibility/runtime changes: preserve guardrails captured in current tests and architecture constraints.
